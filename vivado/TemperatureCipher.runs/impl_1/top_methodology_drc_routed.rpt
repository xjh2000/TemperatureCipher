2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.503 ns between uart_recv_b8_inst/uart_data_reg[20]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and led_inst/number_display_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.568 ns between uart_recv_b8_inst/uart_data_reg[20]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and led_inst/number_display_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.721 ns between uart_recv_b8_inst/uart_data_reg[20]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and led_inst/number_display_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.763 ns between uart_recv_b8_inst/uart_data_reg[20]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and led_inst/number_display_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
